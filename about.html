            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a passionate web developer with a strong academic background in <strong>Mathematics</strong>. I enjoy building responsive web applications while applying logical reasoning and analytical thinking developed through mathematical training.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interest in Mathematics has strengthened my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and ability to break complex problems into structured solutions. These are some of the qualities that made me go into software development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am continuously learning, combining theory with practical experience to create efficient, reliable, and user-friendly digital products.
